# News-Homepage
This is my solution to the "News Homepage" challenge from Frontend mentor using Hyper Text Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript and TypeScript. 

The point of the challenge was to make the given design and make it responsible.
The main section the picture was made using a div and the "background-image" css property. The background-image changes using media queries.
The main section was made using grid, and I made it responsive using media queries.
The other responsive elements are made using flexbox and media queries just changes the "flex-direction".

On smaller screen sizes, the navigation changes to a burger menu.
Onclick propery was made using TypeScript converted to Javascript.

I tried optimizing the memory it uses as much as I could. If anyone notices something that could be improved in could or the layout, let me know!
Thx!
